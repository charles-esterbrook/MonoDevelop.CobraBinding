Cobra Language Binding for MonoDevelop
======================================
This branch is for experimental code that adds new features and breaks existing ones.  You should only use it if you want to hack on the addin itself.

This is an addin for MonoDevelop that allows you to write, run, and debug programs written in the Cobra programming language.

At present, this addin only works on the 3.0 series of MonoDevelop.


To Compile and Use
------------------

1) Compile or install Cobra and then copy the Cobra.Compiler.dll and Cobra.Core.dll assembly files into the CobraBinding/bin folder. The addin uses these for parsing the Cobra source code.

2) Open the solution file in MonoDevelop 3.0

- This Addin is developed on Ubuntu.  To compile on Windows, you'll need to re-establish the reference to the MonoDevelop.Core assembly by expanding 'References' and right-clicking on MonoDevelop.Core and selecting 'Delete.'  If you're not compiling on Windows, just proceed to Step 2.

- Next, right-click on 'References' and select 'Edit References...'

- On the '.Net Assembly' tab, navigate to the location where MonoDevelop is installed and select
the MonoDevelop.Core.dll assembly under the bin folder (e.g. C:\Program Files (x86)\MonoDevelop\bin\MonoDevelop.Core.dll).

- Be sure to click the 'Add' button before clicking 'OK.'

3) Select Build > Build All.  This will generate a MonoDevelop.CobraBinding.dll assembly file in CobraBinding/bin/Debug.

4) Copy MonoDevelop.CobraBinding.dll to the MonoDevelop addins folder. This location depends on your operating system.

- Ubuntu : ~/.local/share/MonoDevelop-3.0/LocalInstall/Addins

- Mac : ~/Library/Application Support/MonoDevelop-3.0/LocalInstall/Addins

- Windows 7 : ~/AppData/Local/MonoDevelop-3.0/LocalInstall/Addins (on Windows ~ is usually c:\users\<username>, also note that AppData is a hidden folder)

If any folders do not exist, you should create them manually.

5) Restart MonoDevelop and you should now have a "Cobra" section when creating a new project/solution.


Contributing
============
Any and all help is appreciated.  See below for tips on getting started.


Low-hanging Fruit
-----------------
These are some of the easier tasks that still need to be done...

* Create icons for project and file templates

* Create additional file templates

* Create some color schemes that match those on the Cobra website.


Larger Todo Tasks
-----------------
These will require a bit more effort...

* Proper handling for project options and compiler configuration.

* Parser, Autocompletion, code formatting, code folding, etc. (this task is in progress)

* Rewrite it in Cobra! This one will actually be easy once the other tasks are done ;)
